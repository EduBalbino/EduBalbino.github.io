A **battery management system** (**BMS**) is any electronic system that manages a [rechargeable battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery "Rechargeable battery") ([cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_cell "Electrochemical cell") or [battery pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack "Battery pack")), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its [safe operating area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_operating_area), monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or [balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_balancing "Battery balancing") it.

A [battery pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack "Battery pack") built together with a battery management system with an external communication [data bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing) "Bus (computing)") is a [smart battery pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_battery_pack "Smart battery pack"). A smart battery pack must be charged by a [smart battery charger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_battery_charger "Smart battery charger").
